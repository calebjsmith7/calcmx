# Welcome to CalcMX (expo)

This is a demo app to show real functionality in apps used around the world. This app was only ever in testflight (through Caleb's appstoreconnect). If it ever needs to be launched, you can simply create an app on messenger's app store connect, create an eas expo account, change the bundleId for the app to the correct new one, and launch it.
